# Rosalind Python Solutions: Bioinformatics Stronghold

This repository contains Python solutions to the `Bioinformatics Stronghold` section of problems from Rosalind, a platform for learning bioinformatics and computational biology through problem-solving. It focuses on solving computational biology problems that build essential skills for analyzing biological data and implementing algorithms in Python.

## Introduction (Bioinformatics1.py)
This project focuses on solving bioinformatics challenges involving DNA/RNA sequences, recurrence relations, GC content, and other genomic computations. These solutions were written to practice coding while applying biological insights.

### Dataset Handling

Input data is typically provided in FASTA or plain-text formats. Custom parsing functions are included to handle: `FASTA sequences` and `Long genomic datasets`.

### Solutions

##### 1. Counting DNA Nucleotides </p>
Problem: Count occurrences of A, T, G, and C in a given DNA string. </p>
Solution: Using Python’s str.count() method.

##### 2. Transcribing DNA to RNA </p>
Problem: Convert a DNA sequence to its RNA equivalent by replacing T with U. </p>
Solution: Implemented using str.replace().

##### 3. Computing Reverse Complement </p>
Problem: Generate the reverse complement of a DNA sequence using complement mappings. </p>
Solution: A dictionary maps A ↔ T and C ↔ G, with Python’s reversed() and join() used to reverse and complement the sequence.

##### 4. Rabbits and Recurrence Relations </p>
Problem: Solve a modified Fibonacci problem to predict rabbit population growth over months. </p>
Solution: A dynamic programming approach using recurrence relations: </p>
        F(n)=F(n−1)+k×F(n−2) </p>
        F(n)=F(n−1)+k×F(n−2)

##### 5. Computing GC Content </p>
Problem: Calculate the percentage of G and C bases in DNA sequences provided in FASTA format. </p>
Solution: A function iterates through sequences, calculates GC content, and identifies the sequence with the highest GC content.
