# Rosalind Python Solutions: Bioinformatics Stronghold

This repository contains Python solutions to the `Bioinformatics Stronghold` section of problems from Rosalind, a platform for learning bioinformatics and computational biology through problem-solving. It focuses on solving computational biology problems that build essential skills for analyzing biological data and implementing algorithms in Python.

## Introduction (Bioinformatics1.py)
This project focuses on solving bioinformatics challenges involving DNA/RNA sequences, recurrence relations, GC content, and other genomic computations. These solutions were written to practice coding while applying biological insights.

### Dataset Handling

Input data is typically provided in FASTA or plain-text formats. Custom parsing functions are included to handle: `FASTA sequences` and `Long genomic datasets`.

### Solutions

1. Counting DNA Nucleotides
Problem: Count occurrences of A, T, G, and C in a given DNA string.
Solution: Using Python’s str.count() method.

2. Transcribing DNA to RNA

    Problem: Convert a DNA sequence to its RNA equivalent by replacing T with U.
    Solution: Implemented using str.replace().

3. Computing Reverse Complement

    Problem: Generate the reverse complement of a DNA sequence using complement mappings.
    Solution: A dictionary maps A ↔ T and C ↔ G, with Python’s reversed() and join() used to reverse and complement the sequence.

4. Rabbits and Recurrence Relations

    Problem: Solve a modified Fibonacci problem to predict rabbit population growth over months.
    Solution: A dynamic programming approach using recurrence relations:
    F(n)=F(n−1)+k×F(n−2)
    F(n)=F(n−1)+k×F(n−2)

5. Computing GC Content

    Problem: Calculate the percentage of G and C bases in DNA sequences provided in FASTA format.
    Solution: A function iterates through sequences, calculates GC content, and identifies the sequence with the highest GC content.
