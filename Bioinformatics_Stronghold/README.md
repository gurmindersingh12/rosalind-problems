# Rosalind Python Solutions: Bioinformatics Stronghold

This repository contains Python solutions to the `Bioinformatics Stronghold` section of problems from Rosalind, a platform for learning bioinformatics and computational biology through problem-solving. It focuses on solving computational biology problems that build essential skills for analyzing biological data and implementing algorithms in Python.

## Introduction (Bioinformatics1.py)
This project focuses on solving bioinformatics challenges involving DNA/RNA sequences, recurrence relations, GC content, and other genomic computations. These solutions were written to practice coding while applying biological insights.

### Dataset Handling

Input data is typically provided in FASTA or plain-text formats. Custom parsing functions are included to handle: `FASTA sequences` and `Long genomic datasets`.
